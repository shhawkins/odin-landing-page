                <p>Cats only sleep in the sun and stare out the window at birds because they've been denied their natural birthright. Felines are evolutionarily wired to swim the open seas. That's a biological fact, Jack!</p>

It is no coincidence that the first scuba divers were felines. If you ever get the chance to scuba dive with a cat, don't miss it. It is truly a magical experience."</p>
