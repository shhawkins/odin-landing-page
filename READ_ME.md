This is a landing page project for the Odin Project Foundations course. It is a website for a cat scuba diving shop.

This was my first time making a landing page from scratch. I used flexbox for the layout. It took me all afternoon and evening. Very fun to fiddle with.

Excited to move on to JavaScript!
